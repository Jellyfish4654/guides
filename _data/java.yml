# keep in mind
# the purpose of this isn't just to teach java
# but to teach how to think like a programmer --> exercises

## things to add
##  - woops, ternary
##  - methods; method overloading
##  - classes: members (final etc), nested classes, methods
##  - classes: private/protected;;;
##  - classes: static members, static constructors
##  - inheritance, abstract & final classes & methods
##  - interfaces & polymorphism & interface inheritance; default methods
##  - exception handling: try/catch
##  - enums
##  - generics
##  - functional interfaces & closures
##  - reading documentation

## exercise ideas
##  - find the zero of any given arbitrary double->double function using derivatives;   requires functions
##  - find the sum of all primes below 2 million [euler 10];                            requires Set/generics     introduces algorithmic complexity
##  - how many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century
##            (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)? [euler 19];                                  requires classes
