# keep in mind
# the purpose of this isn't just to teach java
# but to teach how to think like a programmer --> exercises

## things missing
##  - ternary operator
##  - null values

## things to add
##  - methods; method overloading
##  - classes: members (final etc), nested classes, methods, null
##  - classes: static members, static constructors
##  - inheritance, abstract & final classes & methods
##  - interfaces & polymorphism & interface inheritance; default methods
##  - exception handling: try/catch
##  - enums
##  - generics
##  - functional interfaces & closures

## exercise ideas
##  - find the zero of any given arbitrary double->double function using derivatives;   requires functions
##  - find the sum of all primes below 2 million [euler 1est0];                            requires Set/generics     introduces algorithmic complexity
## skills to test
##  - string parsing/formatting
##  - collection classes
##  - file IO

## red exercises
##  - Sunday thing - in reality not that bad [day 4]
##  - 2048 [day 7]
