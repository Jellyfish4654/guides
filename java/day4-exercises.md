    <li class="task-green">Print all even numbers between 1 and 100, first using a <code>for</code> loop then using a <code>while</code> loop [2 separate programs].</li>
    <li class="task-yellow">Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum. <small><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=6">[E6]</a></small></li>
    <li class="task-yellow">Print the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</li>
    <li class="task-yellow">
        <small>[a]</small> Print a 12x12 multiplication table (rip formatting)
        <small>[b]</small> Print an NxN multiplication table, where N is determined by user input.
    </li>
    <li class="task-orange">
        <small>[a]</small> Print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
        <small>[b]</small> Print the 40th to 45th Fibonacci numbers 
        <small>[c]</small> Print the 40th to 45th Lucas numbers
        <small>[d]</small> Print the 40th to 45th of any arbitrary sequence like the Fibonacci or Lucas numbers, where the first two numbers come from user input. 
    <blockquote> Lucas numbers are defined just like the fibonacci numbers (L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)), but they start with 2 and 1 instead of 1 and 1. So the first few Lucas numbers are 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11</blockquote></li>
